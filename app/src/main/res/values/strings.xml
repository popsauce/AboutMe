\n\nPanda Preserve
\n\nTime limit: 10 seconds
\n\nLast month, Sichuan province secured funding to establish the Great Panda National Park, a natural
\n\npreserve for a population of more than 1 800 giant pandas. The park will be surrounded by a polygonal
\n\nfence. In order for researchers to track the pandas, wireless receivers will be placed at each vertex of the
\n\nenclosing polygon and each animal will be outfitted with a wireless transmitter. Each wireless receiver
\n\nwill cover a circular area centered at the location of the receiver, and all receivers will have the same
\n\nrange. Naturally, receivers with smaller range are cheaper, so your goal is to determine the smallest
\n\npossible range that suffices to cover the entire park.
    Input
The first line of the input contains an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 2 000) specifying the number of vertices
of the polygon bounding the park. This is followed by n lines, each containing two integers x and y
(|x|, |y| ≤ 10 4 ) that give the coordinates (x, y) of the vertices of the polygon in counter-clockwise order.
The polygon is simple; that is, its vertices are distinct and no two edges of the polygon intersect or touch,
except that consecutive edges touch at their common vertex.
Output
Display the minimum wireless range that suffices to cover the park, with an absolute or relative error of
at most 10 −6 .

ACM-ICPC World Finals 2018 Problem G: Panda Preserve
14Problem H
Single Cut of Failure
Time limit: 6 seconds
The Intrusion and Crime Prevention Company (ICPC) builds intrusion detection systems for homes and
businesses. The International Collegiate Programming Contest (in a strange coincidence also known as
ICPC) is considering hiring the company to secure the room that contains the problem set for next year’s
World Finals.
The contest staff wants to prevent the intrusion attempts that were made in past years, such as rappelling
down the outside of the building to enter through a window, crawling through air ducts, impersonating
Bill Poucher, and the creative use of an attack submarine. For that reason, the problems will be stored in
a room that has a single door and no other exits.
ICPC (the company) proposes to install sensors on the four sides of the door, where pairs of sensors are
connected by wires. If somebody opens the door, any connected sensor pair will detect this and cause
an alarm to sound.
The system has one design flaw, however. An intruder might cut the wires before opening the door. To
assess the security of the system, you need to determine the minimum number of line segments that cut
all wires. Figure H.1 shows two configurations of wires on the door (corresponding to the two sample
inputs), and minimum-size cuts that intersect all wires.</string>
